## Description

_This website uses two calculators to depict valuable mortgage payment information. One is a recalculator that uses interactive sliders to show the relationship between monthly payments necessary for a desired age of payoff and vice versa.  The next calculator is an adjustable amortization table that shows you your current monthly payments and months left.  This table also allows you to adjust monthly payments individually and see how it affects your over all savings and length of term in months._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Via Github

```
git clone github.com:GDBMedia/mortgage
```


## Future Improvements

_Add another form with three input fields that will dynamically adjust a pie chart showing the total payment details.



## Technologies Used
